 * Test on Windows.
 * Test on more POSIX platforms.
 * Better error handling.
 * Finish and PyPI-ify setup.py.
 * Maybe better state management (currently state is a module global...).
 * Test on Python 2.x, figure out the earliest version that's easy to support.
 * Is there a way to incorporate cbreak mode into the model?
 * Could we implement timeouts for get*ch* and khbit on Win32? (Easy on POSIX.)
